# This class is meant to be used in a distro or local conf via
# INHERIT += "supported-recipes".
#
# It automatically excludes unsupported recipes from the world build,
# without having to maintain a set of REMOVE_FROM_WORLD_pn-<recipe>
# entries in an include file.
#
# In addition, there is a pre-build check whether any unsupported
# recipes are required to complete the build. This check is optional,
# see SUPPORTED_RECIPES_CHECK.
#
# Build tools and native recipes are ignored by the class itself.
# Those are considered less important (problems in them cannot be
# exploited on the target platform) and/or they are supported
# by the provider of these tools.

# Space-separated list of filenames of files containing recipe names.
# Content of these files are recipes names, one per line.
# Empty lines and lines starting with a hash are ignored.
SUPPORTED_RECIPES ??= ""

# Empty skips check, "note/warn/error/fatal" increases the logging level,
# with "fatal" aborting the build.
SUPPORTED_RECIPES_CHECK ??= ""

# Maximum number of dependency chains to print when the check fails.
# Depending on a recipe deep in the stack can produce a lot of output,
# this here acts as safeguard.

Each unsupported recipe is identified by the recipe name and the collection
in which it occurs and has to be marked as supported (see below) using that
format. Typically each layer has exactly one collection.

Here are the dependency chains (including DEPENDS and RDEPENDS)
which include one or more of the unsupported recipes. -> means "depends on"
and * marks unsupported recipes:
  ''',

To avoid this message, several options exist:
* Disable the check with SUPPORTED_RECIPES_CHECK = "" in local.conf.
* Add the unsupported recipes to one of the following files:
  %s
* If the recipe is supported in some other layer, disable the unsupported one
  with BBMASK.
* Create a new file which lists the unsupported recipes and extend SUPPORTED_RECIPES:
    SUPPORTED_RECIPES_append = " <path>/recipes-supported-by-my.txt"
  See meta-ostro/conf/layer.conf and ostro.conf for an example how the path can be
  derived automatically. The expectation is that SUPPORTED_RECIPES gets set in
  distro configuration files, depending on the support provided by the distro
  creator.
* Check the dependency chain(s) to see why a recipe gets pulled in and perhaps
  change recipe configurations or image content to avoid pulling in undesired
  components.
  'bitbake -g <build target>' produces .dot files showing these dependencies.
